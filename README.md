### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mohamad.

I'm a former Manufacturing Engineer turned Software Engineer residing in Toronto, Canada.

I joined Tesla as the company was leaping into automation for the assembly line. My work there exposed me to high-level robotic programming and deepened my interest in Software Engineering.

Most recently, I built [![Trellis](https://github.com/Trellis-Deployment/trellis/blob/main/client/src/Resources/favicon-32x32.png) Trellis](https://trellis-deployment.github.io/), a deployment pipeline for serverless applications.

Some of my hobbies include:

- :skier: Skiing
- :running_man: Running
- :weight_lifting: Weight Lifting
- :swimming_man: Swimming
- :chess_pawn: Chess
- :book: Reading
